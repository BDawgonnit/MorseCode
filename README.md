Morse Code
==========

UPDATE: This was my code submission to a company called TrueFit from several years ago. I was applying for a front end developer position at the time, so I focused my efforts on JavaScript. Though I would do many things differently now - like use modules, build steps with a tool like Webpack or Rollup and Babel or some other transpiler with ES6+ syntax - I like to keep this around for a few reasons but, mostly, it serves as a demonstration of how I've grown over the years.


The Problem
-----------
Morse code is a way to encode messages in a series of long and short sounds or visual signals. During transmission, operators use pauses to split letters and words.

Please write a program which will translate lines of Morse code into readable English text. The program should:

1. Accept a flat file as input.
2. Each new line will contain a string of Morse code. The characters used will be:
	1.	. = dot
	2.	\- = dash
	3.	| = break
3. Output the English text for each line

Sample Input
------------
-..|---|--.

....|.|.-..|.-..|---||.--|---|.-.|.-..|-..

Sample Output
-------------
dog

hello world
